## Key Points
* COUNT(*): Counts the number of rows.
* SUM(column_name): Calculates the sum of values in a column.
* AVG(column_name): Calculates the average of values in a column.
* MIN(column_name): Finds the minimum value in a column.
* MAX(column_name): Finds the maximum value in a column.
* Concat(column_name1,column_name2); to concatenate two columns
* ORDER BY :ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set in ascending or descending order.
   syntax = SELECT column1, column2, ...
            FROM table_name
            ORDER BY column_name Â  
            ASC/DESC;
* GROUP BY :GROUP BY clause is used to group rows based on one or more columns. It's often used with aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX.
   syntax = SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)
            FROM table_name
            GROUP BY column1;
* ORDER BY and GROUP BY:combine ORDER BY and GROUP BY to sort the grouped results.
   syntax = SELECT country, AVG(age) AS average_age
            FROM customers
            GROUP BY country
            ORDER BY average_age DESC;
